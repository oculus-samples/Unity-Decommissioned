  sceneDescription: 'This example scene provides a mock code example of how to integrate
    avatars into a networking packet queue. It contains the first-person user avatar
    and a third-person avatar that mimics user movements. This scene also shows how
    to launch the avatar editor.

    

    The provided code shows how calling
    the <b>OvrAvatarEntity</b> method <b>RecordStreamData()</b> captures 1st-person
    avatar movement as binary data ideal for sending over a network. When retrieved
    from the packet queue, it is passed to the <b>ApplyStreamData()</b> method to
    allow the 3rd-person avatar to mimic the user.'
