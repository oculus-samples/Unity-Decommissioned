  sceneDescription: "This scene enables multiple skinning types and shows them all
    side-by-side via the OvrAvatarSkinningOverride monobehavior.\r\n\r\nIn general,
    you\u2019ll want to use the default skinning type provided in OvrAvatarSdkManager,
    OVR_COMPUTE, but we\u2019ve included avatars rendered with our legacy skinning
    type, OVR_GPU and the failsafe UNITY skinning type in this scene.\r\n\r\nThis
    scene is for illustrative purposes only . The UNITY skinning type has poor performance
    and is not recommended in production. We also do not recommend using multiple
    different skinning types in the same scene (as shown in this example) because
    of high performance overhead."
